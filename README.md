Project carried out for application to the Junior Data Scientist position.
In this project, the aim was to predict or project the consumption of any store. To carry out this project, 
I used the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, xgboost. Additionally, 
I employed an outlier cleaning processing called the 'Hampel filter'.

The variables used were the previous hour's consumption, hour, day, day of the week, day of the year, 
season, and week of the year.
